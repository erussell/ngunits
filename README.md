# NGUnits libraty

This package contains the NGUnits library

## Do we really need another units library?

[JScience](http://jscience.org/), and its successor, the [unitsofmeasure API](http://code.google.com/p/unitsofmeasure/) and its implementation in [Eclipse UOMo](http://git.eclipse.org/c/uomo/org.eclipse.uomo.git/) are mature, full-featured libraries for handling units and unit conversions. Why do we need another units library? Because those libraries are fundamentally built for handing units that are known at compile time. Using them to parse and/or define new units at runtime is _painful_, to put it mildly. If you are dealing with units that are known at compile time, I strongly recommend you use [UOMo](http://git.eclipse.org/c/uomo/org.eclipse.uomo.git/) instead of NGUnits. If your units of measure are not known until runtime, you should give NGUnits a try.

## Is there documentation?

No, but if you ask nicely I could be persuaded to write some.

## What is the license?

NGUnits itself is released under a BSD license
